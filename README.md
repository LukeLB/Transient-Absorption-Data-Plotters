# Transient-Absorption-Data-Plotters
Python scripts(v 3.7.3 - Anaconda Environment) used to plot transient absorption spectral data. Two python files are provided (TVAS_plotter.py and TEAS_plotter.py) each with corresponding test.csv files. The color scheme for both is set to "viridis". Both scripts are implemented using the pandas and matplotlib libraries and will benefit the user by providing publication quality plots and auto removing lines from spectra.
